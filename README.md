01_Challenge README

Description: For this challenge, I reworked the given HTML and CSS to make it more logical, use less <div>, and tighten the CSS. My comments are located in the HTML and CSS files, respectively. I also added accessibility features, such as alt tags for images, and edited the title of the webpage. The only thing I had trouble with was following the 'Scouts' Code', because I wasn't sure what to leave in for reference for grading, as well as would have preferred to probably do the CSS all over instead of editing it.
